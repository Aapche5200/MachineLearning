# MachineLearning
Machine learning algorithm written by myself with Python 3.6
## What's in it?
+ **Supervised Learning**
1. [KNN](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/KNN.py)
2. [DecisionTree](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/DecisionTree.py)
3. [NaiveBayes](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/NaiveBayes.py)
4. [LogisticRegression](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/LogisticRegression.py)
+ **Unsupervised Learning**
+ **Ensemble Learning**

## Notes
1. The detection-performance comparison codes  between this [repository](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) are in [ModelTest](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/tree/master/ModelTest) 
2. dataset1 is for the test of [KNN](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/KNN.py), [DecisionTree](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/DecisionTree.py), [NaiveBayes](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/NaiveBayes.py)
3. dataset2 is for the test of [LogisticRegression](https://github.com/DandelionLau/MachineLearning/blob/master/LogisticRegression.py)

## Dependences
1. Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
